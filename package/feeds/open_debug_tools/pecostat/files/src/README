Short notes about the "pecostat version 0.9.2":

This is an adaptation of the "pecostat" tool for the "Big Endian" system.

The LOADABLE KERNEL MODULE
==========================

The submitted "pecostat.ko" Loadable Kernel Module should work with the
"2.6.20.9smtc SMP" Linux kernel.
In case when the "/sbin/insmod pecostat.ko" would fail, please follow the
steps below to compile own version of the module:

 - The scripts used for the compilation assume utilization of a cross-compiler.
   In particular, the TimeSys tool chain has been used with Big Endian
   compiler located at /opt/timesys/toolchains/mipsisa32-linux/bin

 - Compile your Linux kernel using the cross-compiler.

 - Modify the supplied "Makefile", specifying
   the GCC (here: GCC=mipsisa32-linux-gcc)
   the CROSS_COMPILER_OPTION (here: CROSS_COMPILE_OPTION=mipsisa32-linux-)
   the Kernel Version (here: KernelVersion=2.6.20.9smtc)
   the MODDIR (here: MODDIR=/ext/Linux/modules/2.6.20.9/BEsmp)

 - modify the "mk_lkm.sh" inserting to the PATH the directory where the
   cross-compiler is located (here: /opt/timesys/toolchains/mipsisa32-linux/bin)

 - execute the "mk_lkm.sh" script.
   As a result the "pecostat.ko" and "pecostat_lkm.ko" should be created.

The "pecostat" TOOL
===================

 - The provided "pecostat" binary should work for you without any modifications.
   It is the "Big Endian" version.

 - In case when own compilation of "pecostat" is preferred, modify the
   "mk_tool.sh" inserting to the PATH the directory where the
   cross-compiler is located (here: /opt/timesys/toolchains/mipsisa32-linux/bin)
   then execute the "mk_tool.sh" script.


TEST OF FUNCTIONALITY
=====================

 - Install the Loadable Kernel Module with "/sbin/insmod pecostat.ko"
 - Run the "pecostat.sh 1 1" and verify if the generated 6 lines of output
   provide expected values (in particular for the "Cycles" and "Instruction
   Completed").
