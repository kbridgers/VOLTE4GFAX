                This should be disabled unless there is an FXO chip connected to
                the GPIOs of the SmartSLIC. Otherwise the SmartSLIC may consume
                quite some processor power depending on the signals on the GPIO pins
                of the SmartSLIC.
                Do not set for the LANTIQ xRX100 or xRX200 Family boards.
                Set it for the LANTIQ Compact GW188 and xRX300 Family boards.
